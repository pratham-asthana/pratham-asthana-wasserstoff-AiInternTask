# Object Segmentation and Identification

This project is a comprehensive solution for object segmentation and identification using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to process images, segment objects within them, and identify and label these objects. It features a user-friendly Streamlit GUI that allows users to upload images, segment objects, save them with unique IDs, and maintain a database for object identification.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pratham-asthana/object-segmentation-and-identification.git
    cd object-segmentation-and-identification
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```

2. Upload an image via the GUI to segment and identify objects.

3. The segmented objects are saved with unique IDs, and the results are displayed along with the labels.

## Features

- **Object Segmentation**: Segments objects in an uploaded image using deep learning models.
- **Object Identification**: Identifies and labels segmented objects.
- **Streamlit GUI**: A simple and intuitive user interface to interact with the model.
- **Database Management**: Maintains a database of segmented objects for future reference and identification.
- **Real-time Processing**: Provides instant feedback and results.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for developing the project.
- **Streamlit**: Framework used to create the web-based GUI.
- **OpenCV**: Library for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework used for object segmentation and identification models.
- **MediaPipe**: Used for posture detection, which can be integrated into the broader object segmentation tasks.

## Results

The project demonstrates the ability to accurately segment and identify objects within images. The Streamlit application provides a user-friendly interface for uploading images and processing them in real-time. The results include segmented objects saved with unique IDs, along with their corresponding labels. The database management system ensures that segmented objects can be efficiently stored and retrieved for future reference.
